<div class="naturalorganic hide"><h3>Our entire existence is made up of chemicals. The food we consume are consisted of inorganic and organic chemicals, and are called 'chemical energy'. Without either one all living species would cease to exist.</h3>
<h3><ul>
<li>Water is inorganic, we rely on it for survival</li>
<li>Minerals are inorganic (and ionic), we will not function without them</li>
<li>Oxygen is inorganic, we need it to be alive</li>
<li>Organic or inorganic cannot be judged by the carbon atom. <strong>Not all organic substances have carbon atom. Not all inorganic substances possess carbon atom</strong></li>
<li>Soap is dangerous, inorganic, drying, irritating, and synthetic, but we cannot seem to live without it</li>
</ul></h3>
<h3><strong>Anything and everything organic is safe and healthy for us than inorganic products?</strong></h3>
<h3><ul>
<li>Urea is organic. Urea is a metabolic waste product excreted by the body, causes algal blooms to produce toxins, associated with primary hypomagnesemia (inborn error of metabolism)</li>
<li>Carbon tetrachloride is organic. It is one of the most potent hepatotoxins, a solvent for laquer, varnish, poisoning by inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption is possible and may be fatal, refrigerant, dry-cleaning, carcinogenic</li>
<li>Pyrethrin and rotenone are organic. They are indiscriminate biocides. Toxic to humans and mammals, but are especially toxic to cats, aquatic animals, bees, and other beneficial insects and pollinators</li>
</ul></h3>
</ul></h3>

<h3>Almost everything we use, drink and consume are synthetically and artificially produced. <strong>Natural means directly from source, 0% human intervention in any form, shape, or way. According to this logic, cooking makes food unnatural and synthetic due to human intervention</strong>.</h3>
<h3>Soap, bread, pasta, cocoa, potable water, electricity, shirt, flour, shoes, cars, paper money and kitchenware do not magically grow on trees that we merely pluck them and use instantly. This is not a fantasy such as Thumbelina emerges from flower.</h3>
<h3><strong>Anything and everything natural is healthy and safe for us than synthetic products?</strong></h3>
<h3><ul>
<li>Botulinum toxin, malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, botulism, and tetanus are natural</li>
<li>Poison hemlock, poison ivy, larkspur, and rhubarb leaf are natural</li>
<li>Profuse diarrhoea and food poisoning due to a long list of pathogenic bacteria is natural</li>
<li>Box jellyfish is all-natural and therefore touching its tentacles is good for you</li>
</ul></h3>
<h3>We consume 'dietary poisons' for daily sustanance. The food we consume contain cyanide, formaldehyde, phytohaemagglutinin, solanine, goitrogens, oxalates, cucurbitacin E, <em>Clostridium botulinum</em> spores, nicotine, carcinogenic compounds, cyanogenic glycoside.</h3>
<h3><em>All things are poisons, for there is nothing without poisonous qualities. It is only the dose which makes a thing poison. Just because a chemical is present, does not mean that it is harmful in the <em>amount</em> present. Any substances if given large enough amounts can cause death. Some are lethal after only a few nanogram, while others require kilograms to a achieve a lethal dose.</em></h3></div>

<div class="preservative hide"><h3>Be a mindful and responsible human. Whether you sell or give away your homemade products of any kind, please add the correct preservative and in appropriate amount. It is all right if you suffer from pain or death from bacterial and mould contamination, but please do not drag others along with you to your planned demise. Sharing should be selfless, but dying should be on your own accord and should be selfish.</h3>
<h3>I reiterate <strong>be a responsible and mindful human by adding preservatives to your products</strong>.</h3>
<h3>Natural preservatives like all 'natural' claims are overrated. They are double-edged swords because they contain some minerals. Minerals promote microbial growth which is why EDTA is often added. EDTA is one of the many ingredients that scare people to death. Fortunately I am not fond of EDTA in my products because there is no need for it.</h3>
<h3>Potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, and phenoxyethanol that are loved by natural/organic practitioners are unnaturally made from sorbic acid, benzoic acid, and phenol. All of a suddenly they are not afraid of the word 'acid' that melts their skin, neither are they afraid of 'phenol' that is highly toxic and readily absorbed through the skin. And suddenly the INCI names that they cannot even pronounce properly are acceptable by them as long as they believe something is organic or natural. Hypocrisy much?</h3>
<h3><em>Boycotters knowingly use what they boycott</em>, miraculously. Natural preservatives are not effective, thus huge concentration is required. When something that high is needed it irritates or burns the skin. Organic or natural preservatives do not mean they are hypoallergenic. Essential oils as natural preservatives are known to cause skin sensitisation and can cause allergic reactions.</h3>

<h3>Japanese Honeysuckle extract is a promising organic and natural preservative. Unfortunately, it is smoke and mirrors. <em>It is not natural as it is created using very sophisticated technology</em>. <strong>If you avoid parabens, you need to avoid Japanese Honeysuckle extract</strong>. Why? It is because parahydroxybenzoic acid found in Japanese Honeysuckle is chemically identical to the synthetic methylparaben. <em>Parahydroxybenzoic acid still contains a benzene ring, which is the main problem with parabens in the first place</em>. The company that makes Japanese Honeysuckle extract, Campo Research, admitted that their Japanese Honeysuckle extract does contain a compound with the same chemical structure as parabens.</h3>
<h3>Grapefruit extract is yet another preservative that carries stupendous organic and natural claims. It is not a preservative. Some people find that it works as a preservative because the extract is contaminated with parabens.</h3>
<h3>The truth is that scientifically parabens and formaldehyde releasers are the two known effective and safe preservatives.</h3></div>

<div class="freesample hide"><h3>I am aware that there is this peculiar 'Malaysian mindset', always want free things and take free things for granted. Worse still, they abuse those testers/samples. Some of them are daring enough to open up sealed products just to try it out.</h3>
<h3>There is no free lunch. <strong>There is always a cost, no matter how indirect or hidden.</strong> Companies giving free samples are not free, the costs are already factored in their products which is the reason why they can afford to give 60% or more discount. Also, people who buy the products are actually paying for those people taking free samples.</h3>
<h3>Although free sample does attract a lot more buyers, I am not interested in the tactic. My goal is making things simple without fancy labelling/packaging, thus keeping cost low so that all people can afford so-called "premium" stuff that normally come with exorbitant prices. I want all people including the poor and students to enjoy premium things. The rich-poor hierarchy is utterly absurd.</h3></div>

<div class="onethingsoap hide"><h3>You certainly can! There is, however, always a combination of things synergising each other. Some things are meant to replace other things. For example, lye is not used as soap, but rather it is adding to fat or oil to make usable soap. Soap is replaced by more skin-friendly surfactants; most soaps these days are zero-soap called 'syndet' (synthetic detergent) that look exactly like soap, smell like soap, feel like soap, but are not soaps.</h3>
<h3>Similarly, a cake is not a cake if there is only flour or sugar. It has ingredients to keept cake moist, mouthfeel, structure, softness, and flavour.</h3></div>
<!-- -->
<div class="skintypes hide"><h3>Skin types are yet another abused and overrated phrase that has more marketing mix than true technical reasons.</h3>
<h3>There is such thing as 'senstive skin', and there is no such thing as 'sensitive skin'. Confused? Most people when they say they have sensitive skin they are referring to their feelings <em>even if there is no apparent symptom</em>. Sensitive skin is <strong>not</strong> a medical term, but a catch-all term. <h3>The most reliable way to test for skin sensitivity is by doing patch test. Patch test studies show that skin reactions affect men and women equally. Anyone regardless of skin types can have sensitive skin. Sensitive skin is not limited to people with sensitive skin. Anybody with sensitive, dry or oily skin touches poison ivy will get the same effect.</h3>
<h3>On the other hand, there is also no such thing as oily/dry skin. You have either overactive sebaceous glands or otherwise. Dry skin can be caused by many factors other than genetics per se. Very oily skin people can have dry (and itchy) skin if he or she went under the sun or hot shower for too long. Soaking in cool water alone is enough to dry skin without anything added to the water. Dry skin people can have oily skin due to hormone changes (females have first-hand experience of this).</h3></div>

<div class="howdoesmoisturiserwork hide"><h3><em>Moisturisers for face/body are nearly identical to conditioners for hair</em>. However, they all contain one or more of the same classes of ingredients &#8722; Humectant, emollient, occlusive.</h3>
<h3><em>Humectants</em> are hygroscopic. Not all humectants are equal in terms of hygroscopicity and humectancy. Hydrates the skin. Can be very tacky.</h3>
<h3><em>Emollients</em> are usually greasy or oily. Can act as occlusives. May or may not hydrate the skin. Humectants can be emollients. Not all emollients are humectants. Emollients make skin appear smooth to the touch by filling gaps between skin cells. Not always effective in keeping in moisture.<h3>
<h3><em>Occlusives</em> are an actual physical barrier (block pores). Can be very waxy or greasy. Total protection against epidermal water lost. Do not hydrate.</h3></div>

<div class="clinicallyproven hide"><h3>'Clinically proven' claims especially anti-aging cream, no amount of products can turn back the time. It is a marketing strategy exploiting fear and insecurity of humans. How then some people find the claims are true? There is no magic but only tricks. Claims as such usually come from self-reported trials, the sample size of volunteers is very small.</h3>
<h3>Another trick used is company's R&D deliberately asks volunteers to <strong>not use moisturiser for days to weeks AND wash face with cleanser (designed to dehydrate the skin) for two weeks</strong>. This indubitably increases dryness or wrinkles. At this point volunteers are asked to use anti-aging cream and asked if their skin condition has improved. Anything that keeps in moisture naturally makes skin looks hydrated or plump up, anti-aging cream is not needed for this trick to work. There are circumstances that volunteers failed to follow company's instruction exactly and still have improved skin. This self-reported data is then passed off as a 'clinical trial' to the consumer.</h3>
<h3>The same trick applies to 'botanical extracts' claims. These are placebos, not functional ingredients that do what they are claimed to do. Likewise, fragrance are part of those botanical extracts, if fragrances worked then companies making moisturisers would close shop, because customers would sniff fragrance and their skin would miraculously be beautified. Why bother with time-consuming skin care ritual when a sniff is all it takes, anywhere, any time, zero inconvenience, zero excuse.</h3>
<h3>So, what about the high number of people said something works? 9 out of 10 volunteers is 90%. <em>But 90% does not represent 6.84 billion people out of the total 7.6 billion people on Earth</em>.</h3>
<h3>There is one other claim that is preposterous beyond realistic. The claim of 20% to 70% sodium hyaluronate/hyaluronic acid.</h3>
<h3><ul>
<li>Sodium hyaluronate is extremely expensive even for 1g</li>
<li>All cosmetics chemists/formulators know that it cannot be used that much due to its extreme thickness above certain percentage. Usually 2% maximum, anymore than this will be unusable</li>
<li>Sodium hyaluronate is useless on its own. Despite of its outstanding water-absorbing power it loses water very quickly. Similar to gelatin or agar-agar, sodium hyaluronate absorbs water many times its weight and shrinks to its dry form as it loses water. It has neither high hygroscopicity nor high water-holding capacity</li>
<li>Notice one of the most famous brands named HA**L*BO is not purely sodium hyaluronate. It contains glycerin and butylene glycol high on the list. Glycerin glycerin hydrates the skin far better than sodium hyaluronate even if glycerin is used alone. Notwithstanding glycerin leaves undesirable stickiness that people hate, it is still the gold standard moisturiser due to its cost-effectiveness that people love. The brand also contains PPG-10 methyl glucose ether, this is what that gives that luxurious feeling</li>
<li>The 'ultra low molecular weight' sodium hyaluronate about 3000 Dalton is still too large to 'penetrate' the skin. The 500 Dalton rule applies, anything larger than 500 Dalton does not penetrate skin with the exception of some substances. The skin is semipermeable and selective to what enters. If things could penetrate the skin easily then injections such as Botox or Restylane would not even be necessary</li>
